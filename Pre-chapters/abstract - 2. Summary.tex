The researcher presents a novel approach to an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework which is inspired from the Yomi concept. The Yomi concept is applied in competitive games where participants have to \textit{read} their opponent's mind.

The proposed AI subsystems in the framework can be categorized into two components: a problem analysis component and a decision making component. Two predictors have been created for the problem analysis component: the Modified Beat Frequent Pick (MBFP) and the Historical Sequence-based Predictor (HSP). The decision making component is comprised of the Yomi AI.

The objectives of the study are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

\item How can the Yomi concept be modeled in decision making for Artificial Intelligence?

\item Can the Yomi Estimator help improve the performance of some specific RoShamBo predictors?

\item What parameters can be considered for the Yomi framework?

\item How can these parameters be automatically fine-tuned?

\end{enumerate}
