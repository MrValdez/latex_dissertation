The Yomi AI framework is inspired after a concept refined by the competitive fighting games community. Yomi is a Japanese word meaning: \textit{to read}. In the context of competitive games, this refers to the idea of reading an opponent's state of mind. The Yomi concept is useful when there's a need to anticipate an opponent's strategy or move. This AI was modeled from the dissertation author's personal experience at participating in competitive games and his own personal application of the Yomi concept.
