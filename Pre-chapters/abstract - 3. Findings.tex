Based on the result of the study, the following findings were drawn:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\item The first International RoShamBo Tournament test suite is used to determine the effectiveness of the AI. It used two ranking systems: the number of matches won \textit{(match results)} and the number of turns won \textit{(tournament results)}. The lower the rank, the better it performs.

For RoShamBo Orthogaming, the highest match ranking Yomi AI variant has a ranking of 7; the highest tournament ranking is 13.

For RoShamBo Metagaming, The highest match ranking Yomi AI variants have a ranking of 3; the highest tournament ranking variant is 6.

\item A two-tailed paired t-test was used to check the effectiveness of adding Yomi to each predictor variant. 

\item The different parameters were identified at chapter \ref{chapter:Results} section \ref{ssec:YomiTrainingProgram}.

\item The use of Genetic Algorithm in the context of metagaming allows for the parameters to be fine-tuned.
