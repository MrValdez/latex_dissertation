Based on the findings and conclusions, the following are the recommended contributions to Yomi AI research:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\item This dissertation focused on developing a general and formal definition of an AI framework using the concept of Yomi. Using this framework, different AIs can be developed.
\item The Yomi concept is applied in competitive games where participants have to \textit{read} their opponent's mind. In this dissertation, the researcher has developed a Yomi estimator based on Markov Chains.
\item This dissertation describes a Genetic Algorithm trainer for use in applying metagaming to the Yomi Estimator and Predictors. This allow the Yomi AI framework to be modified within the context of RoShamBo.
\item This dissertation contributes to the field of Artificial Intelligence and RoShamBo research. The output of this research is a new AI framework that can be used as a basis for new RoShamBo AIs. 
\item RoShamBo is a simple competitive game but future studies can explore the applicability of the Yomi AI framework on other competitive games.
\item The concept of Yomi has been used in competitive games and is a critical aspect of play. At the time of writing, this researcher has not found published research incorporating Yomi into Artificial Intelligence. It is the hope of this researcher that this dissertation will open new doors to utilizing Yomi in AI research.
